# Phuse: A User-Friendly and Intuitive PHP Framework

Phuse is a PHP framework that simplifies web development with conventions and helpers. It follows the convention over configuration principle, which means that it has sensible defaults for most settings and features, reducing the need for manual configuration. It also provides a variety of helpers, which are functions that perform common tasks such as formatting, validation, pagination, and more. Phuse aims to make web development more enjoyable and productive with PHP.

## Features

Some of the main features of Phuse are:

- **MVC Pattern**: Phuse implements the Model-View-Controller pattern, which separates the application logic from the presentation layer. This makes the code more organized, maintainable, and testable.
- **Active Record ORM**: Phuse uses the Active Record pattern, which maps database tables to PHP classes and objects. This makes the database operations easier, faster, and more secure.
- **Routing**: Phuse handles the routing of requests to the appropriate controllers and actions. It supports both static and dynamic routes, as well as RESTful routes for APIs.
- **Validation**: Phuse provides a validation class that allows you to validate the input data from forms, files, or other sources. It supports various rules, filters, and custom messages.
- **Pagination**: Phuse provides a pagination class that allows you to paginate the results from queries or arrays. It supports both simple and advanced pagination, as well as custom templates.
